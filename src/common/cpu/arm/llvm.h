   *consumed is the number of words compiled. At return r15 is the next PC, or
   the faulting PC on an exception; SVC/BKPT advance it by four. A dispatcher
   must check exit and CPSR.T before selecting the next block. Blocks are bounded
   so the caller can poll/schedule between them. Invalidate them on code writes.
